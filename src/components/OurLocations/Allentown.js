            schedule an appointment with a skilled Allentown orthodontist at
            FreySmiles. Virtual consultations are also available if you prefer.

            your first trip to the orthodontist. During this no-obligation
            consultation, we can determine whether braces or Invisalign would be
            best for you. If you happen to reach us after hours, we will follow up
            with you the next business day.During this
          consultation, one of our award-winning orthodontists will talk to you
          about your lifestyle, examine your smile, and make recommendations for
          orthodontic treatment. The
          orthodontists at FreySmiles are Diamond Plus Invisalign providers.
